## Notes
* Unclear user stories
	* GitHub issues - would be better to briefly state what the issue is about, thanks for adding the numbers
	* The Project should be good tested - what do you deine as good?
* Refactoring and improving coding style are different
	* Add an explanation of what high level changes were made
	* Here you can add that as part of refactoring you also improved coding style (what did you improve on)
