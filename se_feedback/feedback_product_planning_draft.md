#Feedback
Well done, visually appealing to read through and structures the document nicely. Thought out and clearly effort was made for this draft.

##Introduction
* These tools are automated and does not require you to run / execute the code
	* does -> do
* And the final chapter will be a glossary
	* I don't believe you have to mention this as a chapter

##Product

###2.1
* epics = a long poem, typically one derived from ancient oral tradition, narrating the deeds and adventures of heroic or legendary figures or the history of a nation.
	* sure that's the right word?
* MoSCoW can be used to further categorise your high level product backlog

##Product Backlog

###3.1
* why is the last user story worth 1pt, supporting more languages is in my opinion minimally as difficult as the other major tasks

##Definition of Done
* DoD for Documents as well
	* Spelling/Grammar, Reviewed, Completeness, etc

##Glossary
* Good glossary with useful terms
* SAT
	* programme -> program (yes there's a difference)
	
##References
* Cool, useful references!
