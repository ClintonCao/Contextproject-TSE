The Sprint Plan will be graded when you turn in the retorspective this Friday (April 29).

* Clearly defined tasks and clearly defined responsibilities
* My advice would be to estimate tasks in pts and not hours
* Make sure your definition of done also covers tasks in the Sprint Plans
* Tasks look evenly split though an overview of how much work each member has been allocated would be nice. Task 1 (Who is the target customer) is worth 2 hours for two people. Does that mean together 2 hours of work or is that 2 hours per person. A table makes it much clearer how you calculate these totals.
