## Notes
* The user stories can be fleshed out a bit more to provide context.
	* ex: Product Vision -> Product Vision, business perspective and stakeholder analysis
* Why was Problem 1, a problem. You got all the tasks done. For future sprints add motivation as to how the problem affected the workflow.
* Simply because I recommended that you estimate in points instead of hours, doesn't mean you have to; missing motivation why you want to make the switch
* Please add a table with the total number of hours per person
