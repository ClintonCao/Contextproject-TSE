## Notes
* The user stories can be fleshed out a bit more to provide context.
	* ex: Product Vision -> Product Vision, business perspective and stakeholder analysis
	* Also write it in the form of a user story when applicable
* You all have unique first names, no need to put the last names everywhere
* Thanks for adding the table
