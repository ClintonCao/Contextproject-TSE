###About
This tool is for creating a visualization of the warnings/defects that were generated by the ASATs (Automated Static Analysis Tools). With this visualization you can get information about the following things:
* From which ASAT most of the warnings are from.
* From which packages (and also classes) most of the warnings are from.
* From which of the three categories (_Functional Defects_, _Maintainability Defects_ and _Other_) most of the warnings are from. (Please take a look at this [paper](http://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/~zaidman/publications/bellerSANER2016.pdf) for more information on the three categories.)

## Requirements:
* One of the following internet browsers: Google Chrome or Safari.
* Java JDK 1.8.
* ASATs version:
  * Checkstyle 6.1.1, PMD 5.2.3 and FindBugs 3.0.1. (CheckStyle 6.17 and PMD version 5.3.2 also work).
* User must have Maven (IDE plugin or standalone app) installed to run `mvn site`. (For more information, please look at the "Maven Execution Research" document). 
* The project (that is going to be analyzed) must be a Maven Project.

## Running the Program:
* Go to the `src/main/java/BlueTurtle/TSE` folder.
* Run the file `Main.java`.
* Follow the instruction on the User Interface.
* Select the project (on your local machine) that you want to visualize.
