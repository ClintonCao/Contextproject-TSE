# Improving the code based on the feedback SIG's tool.
This document provides information on what the team did to improve the code. The improvements are done based on the feedback that the team has received from SIG's tool.

## Recap
On the first upload (of our code) to SIG, we passed 7 out of the 10 guidelines. Please click [here](https://github.com/ClintonCao/Contextproject-TSE/blob/master/documentation/SIG%20Feedback/SIGFeedback.JPG) for an image of the feedback that was given. The three guidelines that we have failed to pass was the following: 
	* Write Short Units of Code.
	* Write Code Once.
	* Automate Tests.
